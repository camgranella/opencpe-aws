# OpenCPE - Open Cloud Policy Executor (AWS)
**_IMPORTANT_: Work in Progress - not ready for usage**

OpenCPE aims to be an all-in-one tool for Cloud resource control focused on notification capabilities with heavily opinionated defaults, aiming at ease of use and maintenance. 

Among the features that differ OpenCPE from other monitoring/notification systems, it includes:
- Pre-defined sensible policies, avoiding a learning curve by requiring users to write their own policies
- All-in-one functionality: logging, mailing and all other actions are not required to install any additional plugins/packages
- Simple configuration, being able to parse all required configuration options by a single JSON file
- Ability to run multiple accounts with specific differing environment needs for each
- Specific edge-case manipulation of policies by including tag-based "ignore" capabilities defined in the configuration file
- Focus on Notification capabilities, for when deleting a resource is a "last-case scenario" and manually having a back and forth with your colleagues is ineffective
